            <p>Field Conspiracy is a social experiment & a record label, which nurtures community and creativity. It
                aims to be a playground of creative space for musicians, where the inspiration and courage to be free in
                a community are leading the life we want to live – so that we can live the life we want to lead.
                Together we imagine a reality where the “human management systems” are defined by the interest of
                communities to live a life that provides them with the security and a space to be free in the creation
                of their own reality.</p>
            <p>When we realize that more can be achieved through the force of creative love than destructive fear and
                fight, then we open the door to collective humanity. The choice lies within all of us, here and now and
                it is what has brought us together in this experiment of positive radicalism in a form of co-operation
                over competition.</p>
